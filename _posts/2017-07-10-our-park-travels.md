Hi! We're a family of four who live in North Carolina. Ever since our kids were in elementary school, we've been taking lots of trips to National Parks. We love to hike the trails, see the beautiful natural scenery, and take side "adventure" trips, like Whitewater rafting and ziplining.

We also like to do a lot of research ahead of time, to find the best places to visit, places to stay, where to eat, etc. We want to share that information with you to make it easier for you to plan your OWN park travels!
