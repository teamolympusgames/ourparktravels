In September 2015 we took a trip to see the [Grand Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm), [Bryce Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm) and [Zion](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm) National Parks.

But first stop was Hoover Dam.

The Grand Canyon is one of the nation's most-visited parks. Fortunately, the canyon is so huge, it's easy to find an unobstructed view. Except at sunset: we had to wander around for a while to find a place to sit and watch, and there were still people in our shot!

We had a fun time riding bikes around the rim.

Our next stop wasn't a national park. Instead we took a little detour into the Navajo reservation to visit Antelope Box Canyon, touted as the most-photographed place in the world.

It's certainly pretty crowded.

Next up was Bryce Canyon, which is famous for its "hoodoo" rock formations.

Then we went to Zion where we hiked the Narrows, which is so narrow that hikers have to wade in the Virgin River nearly the whole way.
