In September 2015 we took a trip to see the South Rim of the [Grand Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm), [Bryce Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm) and [Zion](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm) National Parks.

But first stop was Hoover Dam.

The Grand Canyon is one of the nation's most-visited parks. Fortunately, the canyon is so huge, it's easy to find an unobstructed view. Except at sunset: we had to wander around for a while to find a place to sit and watch, and there were still people in our shot!

**Pro-Tip:** The South Rim has free shuttle buses. These are great if you've taken a hike along the rim and need a lift back. There's also a park-and-ride shuttle from the nearby community of Tusayan, if you can't find parking in the park itself.

We had a fun time riding bikes around the rim.

Our next stop wasn't a national park. Instead we took a little detour into the Navajo reservation to visit Antelope Box Canyon, touted as the most-photographed place in the world.

It's certainly pretty crowded.

**Pro-Tip:** The tour leaves from their home-base in the town of Page, AZ. You ride out to the canyon in what is basically the back of a truck. The ride will take you through a dry riverbed, and is a bit bumpy and dusty.

Next up was Bryce Canyon, which is famous for its "hoodoo" rock formations. There are also lots of Ponderosa pines, which have a delicious smell: something like butterscoth or vanilla.

Then we went to Zion National Park. Zion is another canyon, carved by the Virgin River. In some places the canyon is so narrow that hikers must wade through the river: this is called "The Narrows." We did a few other hikes, including the very strenuous Angel's Landing trail up to Scout's Lookout, and an easier one to Emerald Pools.

**Pro-Tip:** We had planned to enter Zion Nation Park at the East entrance, via US Hwy 89 from Bryce. But the entrance was closed due to a rockfall and we had to take a LONG detour. Call ahead or check highway information!
