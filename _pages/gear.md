No matter which park you visit, you're going to need to pack a few essentials. And to begin with, you'll need something to pack them *in*.

Our work-horse is the [Coleman Tactical Gear Drop 30" Bottom Duffel](http://amzn.to/2vOcZvP). Since we travel as a family of four, we usually check four bags. Two of them are these sturdy duffels. They have rollers and a handle, so you can pull them through the airport like a real jet-setter.

**Pro-Tip:** Most airlines will charge you extra for your bag if it weighs more than 50 pounds.
{: .notice--warning}

Fully-loaded with clothes and other miscellany for a full week's trip, one of these bags will usually come in somewhere between 45 and 50 pounds. Not exactly something to toss over your shoulder, but with careful planning you should be able to get it under the airline's weight limit.

We also usually pack a pair of [Rockland Melbourne 20-Inch Expandable Abs Carry On Suitcases](http://amzn.to/2vOseEW). These are small enough that the children can handle them. They can be carried on the plane, but we usually check them. These are great for shorter trips, or for just packing an overnight bag to bring into the motel, while you leave the Colemans in the back of the car.

If you're like us, you'll be spending a lot of your time hiking the trails. Staying hydrated is key. We've found the [CamelBak Rim Runner 22](http://amzn.to/2vOGa24) to be a great way to pack a good water supply. It's got a handy tube to drink from, as well as several pockets for carrying maps, keys, snacks, and other necessities.
